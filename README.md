# Blogful

View, create, edit, and remove blog posts.


## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`
Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`
Run the tests `npm test`
Seed the `blogful_articles` table with `npm run seed_articles`

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.
